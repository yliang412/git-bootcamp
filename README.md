# Git Bootcamp

## Local Setup

### Installation and configuration (local)

First, check if `git` is installed on your machine by running the following command.
```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.42.0
```

Now add your email and name to the git config:
```bash
$ git config --global user.email jwood@example.com
$ git config --global user.name 'Josh Wood'
```

The `git dag` command is more user friendly than the original `git log` command. Add it by running
```bash
$ git config --global alias.dag "log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(cyan)%aD%C(reset) %C(green)(%ar)%C(reset)%C(yellow)%d%C(reset)%n'' %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(white)- %an%C(reset)' --all"
```

### Making your first commit (local)

Then `cd` into the root directory of your project. For instance, if my project folder is `git-bootcamp`, I would do
```bash
$ cd <SOME_PATH>/git-bootcamp
```

Now, initialize your local git repository on the branch `main` by running
```bash
$ git init -b "main"
Initialized empty Git repository in <SOME_PATH>/git-bootcamp/.git
```

Note that there are files you do not want git to track. For instance, the object files (`.o`) and binary runnable generated by the compiler. You should put things you do not want git to track in a `.gitignore` file in the project root directory. Run `touch .gitignore` in the project root directory and edit it using your favorite editor.

There is one utility I found useful for this purpose. Go to https://gitignore.io and create useful `.gitignore` files based on the language/framework you use. The following link shows the `.gitignore` file for a project written in C and Python. 
https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/python,c. You are always free to add more project specific files/folders based on your need.

Once you are ready, you can run the following commands to make your first commit:
```bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -s -m "initial commit"
```
